## Project Description
This repository provides a minimal and easy-to-use MinUnit setup for unit testing in C. It includes the MinUnit header and a sample test, making it easy to add tests to any C project.

## Background
The motivation for this repository is to offer a quick and reusable base for anyone who wants to add unit tests to their C projects without external dependencies or complex configurations.

## How to Compile and Run the Tests

1. Compile the sample test:

```bash
cc -Iincludes test/test_dummy.c -o test_dummy
```

2. Run the test:

```bash
./test_dummy
```

## How to Integrate MinUnit in Your Project

1. Copy `minunit.h` to your project's include folder.
2. Write your tests in `.c` files using the MinUnit syntax:

```c
#include "minunit.h"

int tests_run = 0;

MU_TEST(test_example) {
    mu_assert("1 == 1", 1 == 1);
    return 0;
}

MU_TEST_SUITE(suite) {
    MU_RUN_TEST(test_example);
}

int main() {
    MU_RUN_SUITE(suite);
    MU_REPORT();
    return 0;
}
```

3. Add a rule to your Makefile to compile the tests. Example:

```makefile
test: test/test_example.c includes/minunit.h
	cc -Iincludes test/test_example.c -o test_example
	./test_example
```

For more complex projects (with dependencies and linking), use a pattern like:

```makefile
TEST_NAME = test_binary
TEST_SRC = test/test_suite.c
TEST_OBJS = $(TEST_SRC:.c=.o)

$(TEST_NAME): $(TEST_OBJS) src_module.o includes/minunit.h
	cc -Iincludes $(TEST_OBJS) src_module.o -o $(TEST_NAME) -lpthread

test: $(TEST_NAME)
	./$(TEST_NAME)
```

You can create as many test files as you need and add similar rules to your Makefile.

MinUnit is simple, requires no installation or external dependencies. Just include the header and compile your tests.

## How to Use the Setup and Purge Scripts

### Setup Script
To add MinUnit to your project, run:

```bash
sh minunit-setup.sh <include_dir>
```
Replace `<include_dir>` with the folder where you want to place `minunit.h` (e.g., `includes`).

- The script will create the necessary structure and files if they do not exist.
- If a Makefile is present, you will be prompted to add a MinUnit test target.

### Purge Script
To completely remove MinUnit from your project, run:

```bash
sh minunit-purge.sh <include_dir>
```
Replace `<include_dir>` with the folder where `minunit.h` is located (e.g., `includes`).

- The script will ask for confirmation before deleting each file or directory.
- You will be reminded to remove the MinUnit target from your Makefile if it exists.

## Common Errors and Solutions

### Error: minunit.h not found

**Symptom:**
The compiler cannot find the `minunit.h` file.

**Solution:**
Make sure to use the `-Iincludes` option (or the correct path) when compiling:

```bash
cc -Iincludes test/test_dummy.c -o test_dummy
```

### Error: tests_run not defined

**Symptom:**
Linker error for undefined symbol `tests_run`.

**Solution:**
Declare the global variable in each test file:

```c
int tests_run = 0;
```
